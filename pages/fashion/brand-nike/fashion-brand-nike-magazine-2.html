          performance here in honour of their limited edition collaboration collection with Sports

            The pop quintet put up a mini concert at the Nike Orchard Road flagship store to a
            closed group of lucky Nike VIPs plus a little interview segment to get to know the girls
            better. Despite it being a closed event, Bunnies were lined up outside of the store in
            hopes to catch a glimpse of their favourite idol. A true testament of the group's
            incredible global popularity! Not to mention, the group recently won prestigious
            Daesangs at the 2023 MAMA Awards, 2023 Asia Artist Awards, MelOn Music Awards 2023 and
            more.

          For their performance, the largest Nike store in Southeast Asia was transformed into a
          stage where the girls of NewJeans performed their hit tracks, 'Ditto', 'New Jeans', 'Super
          Shy', 'ETA' and 'OMG'. Fans and Nike VIPs were lined up inside the massive three-floor
          store to enjoy their energetic performance with many sporting the Bunnies lightstick.
          Prior to their stage, the group had a tour of the 28,000 square feet space and even
          customised their own Nike By You x NewJeans pieces. The collection features ready-made
          graphic tees and caps as well as customisable pieces of which you can pick from the
          limited edition collab graphics to create your own design. The Nike By You x NewJeans
          customisation experience launches on January 30 exclusively for Nike Members at Nike
          Orchard Road, while stocks last.

          During the Q&A segment, Hanni, Hyein, Danielle, Minji and Haerin shared their first
          impressions of Singapore, their excitement to see the international Bunnies as well as
          their current style obsessions. The girls emphasised their need for comfort on top of
          style which changes depending on their mood that day. They also mentioned their love for
          the new Nike Air Max 90 LV8 of which the group has an exclusive colourway as part of their
          collaboration with the Sportswear giant.
